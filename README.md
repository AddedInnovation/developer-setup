# Windows Developer Automation
Development environment set-up scripts.

First check to see if Chocolatey is operating: https://status.chocolatey.org/

Next, click this link to install the Developer recipe. I recommend you launch this in a private browser in case you need to  make updates to the scripts. Sometimes, the browser likes to cache the URL.
